# mongoose-and-express
### This application was created as part of learning node.js. Most likely, it will not be of interest to you, since it has in some sense a meaningless content. In development, I practiced with 'view engine', namely 'pug' , with mongoose and node.js. 
### But you can install and watch it anyway. For this you need:

1. Enter commands into terminal
  ```
    git clone https://github.com/alexrysukhin/mongoose-and-express.git
  ```
  ```
  cd mongoose-and-express
  ```
2. Install Node.js
3. Enter commands into terminal
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  ```
  node app
  ```
4. After that follow the link http://localhost:3000/
